# Testing

**Site Version :** 1.0  
**Errors found:** Slight bug with resizing   
**Errors fixed:** None      
**Errors Ignored:** resizing   
**Why:** Too small to focus on   

# Delivery 

**Screenshots of final product:** The screenshot is in the images folder as "finalpic"   
**How will it be presented?** It will be linked to the consumer via github   
**Who is presenting what?** The entire group gives a copy to the consumer   
**How did they like it?** They liked it i hope ;)   
**Was there anything to fix or change?** The final project doesnt require fixing, it will be finalized as is.   

# Maintenance

> *This is normally a section for later that is used after development. This time it will be a reflection area.*

**What did you do wrong, and how will you do it differently next time:** As the consumer reported, the blocks of text lokked a bit... weird. Without their input i probably would have left it unchanged. Maybe instead i can review with the consumer sooner?   
**What was the hardest part of this project:** Oh man, the chart js BY FAR was the most annyoing part of the process. I would say i figured it out now, but before it was so difficult i didnt want to continue. I think the only reason i contnued with it was because i spend like 1.5 days on it.   
**What part was the most fun to do:** The JSON. Once i was able to figure it out it was kinda fun to edit things.   
**Is there a way that I could have made this SDLC better or more comprehensive:** Maybe i should have included Jimmy and Jordan in these bits...
